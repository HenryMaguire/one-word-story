       "\"\\nProduced by An Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteer\\n\\nBy Rafael Sabatini'\\n\\n These are they\\n Who ride on the court gale, control its tides;\\n\\n ***\\n\\n Whose frown abases and whose smile exalts.\\n They shine like any rainbow--and, perchance,\\n Their colours are as transient.\\n\\n Old Play\\n\\n\\nIt was spring at Bellecour--the spring of 1789, a short three months\\nbefore the fall of the Bastille came to give the nobles pause, and\\nmake them realise that these new philosophies, which so long they have\\nderided, were by no means the idle vapours they had deemed them.\\n\\nBy the brook, plashing its glittering course through the park of\\nBellecour, wandered La Boulaye, his long, lean, figure clad with a\\nsombreness that was out of harmony in that sunlit, vernal landscape.\\nBut the sad-hued coat belied that morning a heart that sang within his\\nbreast as joyously as any linnet of the woods through which he strayed.\\nThat he was garbed in black was but the outward indication of his\\nclerkly office, for he was secretary to the most noble the Marquis de\\nFresnoy de Bellecour, and so clothed in the livery of the ink by which\\nhe lived. His face was pale and lean and thoughtful, but within his\\ngreat, intelligent eyes there shone a light of new-born happiness. Under\\nhis arm he carried a volume of the new philosophies which Rousseau had\\nlately given to the world, and which was contributing so vastly to the\\nmighty change that was impending. But within his soul there dwelt\\nin that hour no such musty subject as the metaphysical dreams of old\\nRousseau. His mood inclined little to the “Discourses upon the Origin of\\nInequality” which his elbow hugged to his side. Rather was it a mood of\\nsong and joy and things of light, and his mind was running on a string\\nof rhymes which mentally he offered up to his divinity high-born\\nlady was she, daughter to his lordly employer, the most noble Marquis\\nof Bellecour. And he a secretary, a clerk! Aye, but a clerk with a great\\nsoul, a secretary with a great belief in the things to come, which in\\nthat musty tome beneath his arm were dimly prophesied.\\n\\nAnd as he roamed beside the brook, his feet treading the elastic,\\nvelvety turf, and crushing heedlessly late primrose and stray violet,\\nhis blood quickened by the soft spring breeze, fragrant with hawthorn\\nand the smell of the moist brown earth, La Boulaye's happiness gathered\\nstrength from the joy that on that day of spring seemed to invest all\\nNature. An old-world song stole from his firm lips-at first timidly,\\nlike a thing abashed in new surroundings, then in bolder tones that\\nechoed faintly through the trees\\n\\n “Si le roi m'avait donne\\n Paris, sa grande ville,\\n Et qui'il me fallut quitter'amour de ma mie,\\n Je dirais au roi Louis\\n Reprenez votre Paris'aime mieux ma mie, O gai!\\n J'aime mieux ma mie!”\\n\\nHow mercurial a thing is a lover's heart! Here was one whose habits were\\nof solemnity and gloomy thought turned, so joyous that he could sing\\naloud, alone in the midst of sunny Nature, for no better reason than\\nthat Suzanne de Bellecour had yesternight smiled as--for some two\\nminutes by the clock--she had stood speaking with him.\\n\\n“Presumptuous that am,” said he to the rivulet, to contradict himself\\nthe next moment. “But no; the times are changing. Soon we shall be\\nequals all, as the good God made us, and--”\\n\\nHe paused, and smiled pensively. And as again the memory of her\\nyesternight's kindness rose before him, his smile broadened; it became\\na laugh that went ringing down the glade, scaring a noisy thrush into\\nsilence and sending it flying in affright across the scintillant waters\\nof the brook. Then that hearty laugh broke sharply off, as, behind\\nhim, the sweetest voice in all the world demanded the reason of this\\nmad-sounding mirth.\\n\\nLa Boulaye's breath seemed in that instant to forsake him and he grew\\npaler than Nature and the writer's desk had fashioned him. Awkwardly he\\nturned and made her a deep bow.\\n\\n“Mademoiselle! You--you see that you surprised me!” he faltered, like a\\nfool. For how should he, whose only comrades had been books, have\\nlearnt to bear himself in the company of a woman, particularly when she\\nbelonged to the ranks of those whom--despite Rousseau and his other\\ndear philosophers--he had been for years in the habit of accounting his\\nbetters?\\n\\n“Why, then, I am glad, Monsieur, that surprised you in so gay a\\nhumour--for, my faith, it is a rare enough thing.”\\n\\n“True, lady,” said he foolishly, yet politely agreeing with her, “it is\\na rare thing.” And he sighed--“Helas!”\\n\\nAt that the laughter leapt from her young lips, and turned him hot and\\ncold as he stood awkwardly before her.\\n\\n“I see that we shall have you sad at the thought of how rare is\\nhappiness, you that but a moment back were--or so it seemed--so joyous.\\nOr is it that my coming has overcast the sky of your good humour?” she\\ndemanded archly.\\n\\nHe blushed like a school-girl, and strenuously protested that it was not\\nso. In his haste he fell headlong into the sin of hastiness--as was but\\nnatural--and said perhaps too much.\\n\\n“Your coming, Mademoiselle?” he echoed. “Nay but even had been sad,\\nyour coming must have dispelled my melancholy as the coming of the sun\\ndispels the mist upon the mountains.”\\n\\n“A poet?” She mocked him playfully, with a toss of black curls and a\\ndistracting glance of eyes blue as the heavens above them. “A poet,\\nMonsieur, and never suspected it, for all that held you a great\\nscholar. My father says you are.”\\n\\n“Are we not all poets at some season of our lives?” quoth he, for\\ngrowing accustomed to her presence--ravished by it, indeed--his courage\\nwas returning fast and urging him beyond the limits of discretion.\\n\\n“And in what season may this rhyming fancy touch us?” she asked.\\n“Enlighten me, Monsieur.”\\n\\nHe smiled, responsive to her merry mood, and his courage ever swelling\\nunder the suasion of it, he answered her in a fearless, daring fashion\\nthat was oddly unlike his wont. But then, he was that day a man\\ntransformed.\\n\\n“It comes, Mademoiselle, upon some spring morning such as this--for is\\nnot spring the mating season, and have not poets sung of it, inspired\\nand conquered by it? It comes in the April of life, when in our hearts\\nwe bear the first fragrant bud of what shall anon blossom into a\\nglorious summer bloom red as is Love's livery and perfumed beyond all\\nelse that God has set on earth for man's delight and thankfulness.”\\n\\nThe intensity with which he spoke, and the essence of the speech\\nitself, left her a moment dumb with wonder and with an incomprehensible\\nconsternation, born of some intuition not yet understood.\\n\\n“And so, Monsieur, the Secretary,” said she at last, a nervous laugh\\nquivering in her first words, “from all this wondrous verbiage am to\\ntake it that you love?”\\n\\n“Aye, that love, dear lady,” he cried, his eyes so intent upon her\\nthat her glance grew timid and fell before them. And then, a second\\nlater, she could have screamed aloud in apprehension, for the book of\\nJean Jacques Rousseau lay tumbled in the grass where he had flung it,\\neven as he flung himself upon his knees before her. “You may take it\\nindeed that love--that love you, Mademoiselle.”\\n\\nThe audacious words being spoken, his courage oozed away and\\nanti-climax, followed. He paled and trembled, yet he knelt on until\\nshe should bid him rise, and furtively he watched her face. He saw it\\ndarken; he saw the brows knit; he noted the quickening breath, and in\\nall these signs he read his doom before she uttered it.\\n\\n“Monsieur, monsieur,” she answered him, and sad was her tone, “to what\\nlengths do you urge this springtime folly? Have you forgotten so your\\nstation--yes, and mine--that because talk with you and laugh with you,\\nand am kind to you, you must presume to speak to me in this fashion?\\nWhat answer shall make you, Monsieur--for am not so cruel that can\\nanswer you as you deserve.”\\n\\nAn odd thing indeed was La Boulaye's courage. An instant ago he had felt\\na very coward, and had quivered, appalled by the audacity of his own\\nwords. Now that she assailed him thus, and taxed him with that same\\naudacity, the blood of anger rushed to his face--anger of the quality\\nthat has its source in shame. In a second he was on his feet before her,\\ntowering to the full of his lean height. The words came from him in\\na hot stream, which for reckless passion by far outvied his erstwhile\\namatory address.\\n\\n“My station?” he cried, throwing wide his arms. “What fault lies in\\nmy station? I am a secretary, a scholar, and so, by academic right, a\\ngentleman. Nay, Mademoiselle, never laugh; do not mock me yet. In what\\ndo you find me less a man than any of the vapid caperers that fill your\\nfather's salon? Is not my shape as good? Are not my arms as strong, my\\nhands as deft, my wits as keen, and my soul as true? Aye,” he pursued\\nwith another wild wave of his long arms, “my attributes have all these\\nvirtues, and yet you scorn me--you scorn me because of my station, so\\nyou say!”\\n\\nHow she had angered him! All the pent-up gall of years against the\\nsupercilia of the class from which she sprang surged in that moment to\\nhis lips. He bethought him now of the thousand humiliations his proud\\nspirit had suffered at their hands when he noted the disdain with which\\nthey addressed him, speaking to him--because he was compelled to carve\\nhis living with a quill--as though he were less than mire. It was not so\\nmuch against her scorn of him that he voiced his bitter grievance, but\\nagainst the entire noblesse of France, which denied him the right to\\ncarry a high head because he had not been born of Madame la Duchesse,\\nMadame la Marquise, or Madame la Comtesse. All the great thoughts of a\\nwondrous transformation, which had been sown in him by the revolutionary\\nphilosophers he had devoured with such appreciation, welled up now, and\\nsuch scraps of that infinity of thought as could find utterance he cast\\nbefore the woman who had scorned him for his station. Presumptuous he\\nhad accounted himself--but only until she had found him so. By that the\\npresumption, it seemed, had been lifted from him, and he held that what\\nhe had said to her of the love he bore her was no more than by virtue of\\nhis manhood he had the right to say.\\n\\nShe drew back before him, and shrank in some measure of fear, for he\\nlooked very fierce. Moreover, he had said things which professed him a\\nrevolutionist, and the revolutionists, whilst being a class which she\\nhad been taught to despise and scorn, dealt, she knew, in a violence\\nwhich it might be ill to excite.\\n\\n“Monsieur,” she faltered, and with her hand she clutched at her\\nriding-habit of green velvet, as if preparing to depart, “you are not\\nyourself am beyond measure desolated that you should have so spoken\\nto me. We have been good friends, M. La Boulaye. Let us forget this\\nscene. Shall we?” Her tones grew seductively conciliatory.\\n\\nLa Boulaye half turned from her, and his smouldering eye fell upon “The\\nDiscourses” lying on the grass. He stooped and picked up the volume.\\nThe act might have seemed symbolical. For a moment he had cast aside\\nhis creed to woo a woman, and now that she had denied him he returned to\\nRousseau, and gathered up the tome almost in penitence at his momentary\\ndefection.\\n\\n“I am quite myself, Mademoiselle,” he answered quietly. His cheeks were\\nflushed, but beyond that, his excitement seemed to have withered. “It\\nis you who yesternight, for one brief moment and again to-day--were not\\nyourself, and to that you owe it that have spoken to you as have\\ndone.”\\n\\nBetween these two it would seem as the humour of the one waned, that of\\nthe other waxed. Her glance kindled anew at his last words.\\n\\n“I?” she echoed. “I was not myself? What are you saying, Monsieur the\\nSecretary?”\\n\\n“Last night, and again just now, you were so kind, you--you smiled so\\nsweetly--”\\n\\n“Mon Dieu!” she exclaimed, angrily interrupting him. “See what you are\\nfor all your high-sounding vaunts of yourself and your attributes! A\\nwoman may not smile upon you, may not say one kind word to you, but\\nyou must imagine you have made a conquest. Ma foi, you and yours do\\nnot deserve to be treated as anything but vassals. When we show you a\\nkindness, see how you abuse it. We extend to you our little finger and\\nyou instantly lay claim to the whole arm. Because last night permitted\\nmyself to exchange a jest with you, because chance to be kind to you\\nagain to-day, you repay me with insults!”\\n\\n“Stop!” he cried, rousing himself once more. “That is too much to say,\\nMademoiselle. To tell a woman that you love her is never to insult her.\\nTo be loved is never to be slighted. Upon the meanest of His creatures\\nit is enjoined to love the same God whom the King loves, and there is\\nno insult to God in professing love for Him. Would you make a woman more\\nthan that?”\\n\\n“Monsieur, you put questions have no mind to answer; you suggest\\na discussion have no inclination to pursue. For you and me let it\\nsuffice that account myself affronted by your words, your tone, and\\nyour manner. You drive me to say these things; by your insistence you\\ncompel me to be harsh. We will end this matter here and now, Monsieur,\\nand will ask you to understand that never wish it reopened, else\\nshall be forced to seek protection at the hands of my father or my\\nbrother.”\\n\\n“You may seek it now, Suzanne,” quoth a voice from the thicket at her\\nback, a voice which came to startle both of them though in different\\nways. Before they had recovered from their surprise the Marquis de\\nBellecour stood before them. He was a tall man of some fifty years of\\nage, but so powerful of frame and so scrupulous in dress that he might\\nhave conveyed an impression of more youth. His face, though handsome\\nin a high-bred way, was puffed and of an unhealthy yellow. But the eyes\\nwere as keen as the mouth was voluptuous, and in his carefully dressed\\nblack hair there were few strands of grey.\\n\\nHe came slowly forward, and his lowering glance wandered from his\\ndaughter to his secretary in inquiry. At last--\\n\\n“Well?” he demanded. “What is the matter?”\\n\\n“It is nothing, Monsieur,” his daughter answered him. “A trifling affair\\n'twixt. la Boulaye and me, with which will not trouble you.”\\n\\n“It is not nothing, my lord,” cried La Boulaye, his voice vibrating\\noddly. “It is that love your daughter and that have told her of it.”\\n He was in a very daring mood that morning.\\n\\nThe Marquis glanced at him in dull amazement. Then a flush crept into\\nhis sallow cheeks and mounted to his brow. An inarticulate grunt came\\nfrom his thick lips.\\n\\n“Canaille!” he exclaimed, through set teeth. “Can you have presumed so\\nfar?”\\n\\nHe carried a riding-switch, and he seemed to grasp it now in a manner\\npeculiarly menacing. But La Boulaye was nothing daunted. Lost he already\\naccounted himself, and on the strength of the logic that if a man must\\nhang, a sheep as well as a lamb may be the cause of it, he took what\\nchances the time afforded him to pile up his debt.\\n\\n“There is neither insolence nor presumption in what have done,” he\\nanswered, giving back the Marquis look for look and scowl for scowl.\\n“You deem it so because am the secretary to the Marquis de Bellecour\\nand she is the daughter of that same Marquis. But these are no more than\\nthe fortuitous circumstances in which we chance to find ourselves. That\\nshe is a woman must take rank before the fact that she is your daughter,\\nand that am a man must take rank before the fact that am your\\nsecretary. Not, then, as your secretary speaking to your daughter have told this lady that love her, but as a man speaking to a woman. To\\nutter that should be--nay, is--the right of every man; to hear it\\nshould be honouring to every woman worthy of the name. In a primitive\\ncondition--”\\n\\n“A thousand devils!” blazed the Marquis, unable longer to contain\\nhimself. “Am to have my ears offended by this braying? Miserable scum,\\nyou shall be taught what is due to your betters.”\\n\\nHis whip cracked suddenly, and the lash leapt serpentlike into the air,\\nto descend and coil itself about La Boulaye's head and face cry broke\\nfrom the young man, as much of pain as of surprise, and as the lash was\\ndrawn back, he clapped his hands to his seared face. But again he felt\\nit, cutting him now across the hand with which he had masked himself.\\nWith a maddened roar he sprang upon his aggressor. In height he was the\\nequal of the Marquis, but in weight he seemed to be scarce more than\\nthe half of his opponent's. Yet a nervous strength dwelt unsuspected in\\nthose lean arms and steely wrists.\\n\\nMademoiselle stood by looking on, with parted lips and eyes that were\\nintent and anxious. She saw that figure, spare and lithe as a greyhound,\\nleap suddenly upon her father, and the next instant the whip was in the\\nsecretary's hands, and he sprang back from the nobleman, who stood white\\nand quivering with rage, and perhaps, too, with some dismay.\\n\\n“That do not break it across your back, M. le Marquis, said the young\\nman,” as he snapped the whip on his knee, “you may thank your years.”\\n With that he flung the two pieces wide into the sunlit waters of the\\nbrook. “But will have satisfaction, Monsieur will take payment for\\nthis.” And he pointed to the weal that disfigured his face.\\n\\n“Satisfaction?” roared the Marquis, hoarse in his passion. “Would you\\ndemand satisfaction of me, animal?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the young man, with a wry smile. “Your years again\\nprotect you. But you have a son, and if by to-morrow it should come\\nto pass that you have a son no more, you may account yourself, through\\nthis”--and again he pointed to the weal--“his murderer.”\\n\\n“Do you mean that you would seek to cross swords with the Vicomte?”\\n gasped the nobleman, in an unbelief so great that it gained the\\nascendency over his anger.\\n\\n“That is what mean, Monsieur. In practice he has often done so. He\\nshall do so for once in actual earnest.”\\n\\n“Fool!” was the contemptuous answer, more coldly delivered now, for the\\nMarquis was getting himself in hand. “If you come near Bellecour again,\\nif you are so much as found within the grounds of the park, I'll have\\nyou beaten to death by my grooms for your presumption. Keep you the\\nmemory of that promise in mind, Sir Secretary, and let it warn you to\\navoid Bellecour, as you would a plague-house. Come, Suzanne,” he said,\\nturning abruptly to his daughter, “Enough of this delightful morning\\nhave we already wasted on this canaille.”\\n\\nWith that he offered her his wrist, and so, without so much as another\\nglance at La Boulaye, she took her departure.\\n\\nThe secretary remained where they had left him, pale of face--saving the\\nfortuitous crimson mark which the whip had cut--and very sick at heart.\\nThe heat of the moment being spent, he had leisure to contemplate his\\nplight scorned lover, a beaten man, a dismissed secretary! He looked\\nsorrowfully upon his volume of “The Discourses,” and for the first time\\na doubt crossed his mind touching the wisdom of old Jean Jacques. Was\\nthere would there ever be any remedy for such a condition of things as\\nnow prevailed?\\n\\nAlready the trees had hidden the Marquis and his daughter from La\\nBoulaye's sight. The young revolutionist felt weary and lonely--dear\\nGod, how lonely! neither kith nor kin had he, and of late all the\\ninterest of his life--saving always that absorbed by Jean Jacques--had\\nlain in watching Suzanne de Bellecour, and in loving her silently and\\ndistantly. Now that little crumb of comfort was to be his no more, he\\nwas to go away from Bellecour, away from the sight of her for all time.\\nAnd he loved her, loved her, loved her!\\n\\nHe tossed his arms to Heaven with a great sigh that was a sob almost,\\nthen he passed his hands over his face, and as they came in contact\\nwith the swollen ridge that scored it, love faded from his mind, and\\nvindictiveness came to fill its room.\\n\\n“But for this,” he cried aloud. “I shall take payment--aye, as there is\\na God!”\\n\\nThen turning, and with “The Discourses” held tightly to his side, he\\nmoved slowly away, following the course of the gleaming waters\\n\\n\\nOne friend did La Boulaye count in the village of Bellecour. This\\nwas old Duhamel, the schoolmaster, an eccentric pedant and a\\nfellow-worshipper of the immortal Jean Jacques. It was to him that La\\nBoulaye now repaired intent upon seeking counsel touching a future that\\nwore that morning a singularly gloomy outlook.\\n\\nHe found Duhamel's door open, and he stepped across the threshold into\\nthe chief room of the house. But there he paused, and hesitated. The\\nchamber was crowded with people in holiday attire, and the centre of\\nattraction was a well-set-up peasant with a happy, sun-tanned face,\\nwhose golden locks were covered by a huge round hat decked with a score\\nof gaily-coloured ribbons.\\n\\nAt sight of him La Boulaye remembered that it was Charlot's wedding-day.\\nPopular amongst the women by virtue of his comeliness, and respected\\nby the men by virtue of his strength, Charlot Tardivet was a general\\nfavourite of the countryside, and here, in the room of old Duhamel, the\\nschoolmaster, was half the village gathered to do him honour upon his\\nwedding morn. It was like Duhamel, who, in fatherliness towards the\\nvillagers, went near out-rivalling. le Cure, to throw open his house\\nfor the assembling of Charlot's friends, and La Boulaye was touched by\\nthis fresh sign of kindliness from a man whose good heart he had not\\nlacked occasion to observe and appreciate. But it came to the secretary\\nthat there was no place for him in this happy assemblage. His advent\\nwould, probably, but serve to cast a gloom upon them, considering the\\nconditions under which he came, with the signs of violence upon his face\\nto remind them of the lords of life and death who dwelt at the Chateau\\nup yonder. And such a reminder must fall upon them as does the reminder\\nof some overhanging evil clutch suddenly at our hearts in happy moments\\nof forgetfulness. To let them be happy that day, to leave their feasts\\nfree of a death's head, La Boulaye would have withdrawn had he not\\nalready been too late. Duhamel had espied him, and the little, wizened\\nold man came hurrying forward, his horn-rimmed spectacles perched on\\nthe very end of his nose, his keen little eyes beaming with delight and\\nwelcome.\\n\\n“Ah, Caron, you are very choicely come,” he cried, holding out both\\nhands to La Boulaye. “You shall embrace our happy Hercules yonder, and\\nwish him joy of the wedded life he has the audacity to exploit.” Then,\\nas he espied the crimson ridge across the secretary's countenance, “Mon\\nDieu!” he exclaimed, “what have you done to yourself, Caron?”\\n\\n“Pish! It is nothing,” answered La Boulaye hurriedly, and would have had\\nthe subject dismissed, but that one of the onlooking peasants swore\\nby the memory of some long-dead saint that it was the cut of a whip.\\nDuhamel's eyes kindled and his parchment-like skin was puckered into a\\nhundred evil wrinkles.\\n\\n“Who did it, Caron?” he demanded.\\n\\n“Since you insist, old master,” answered the secretary, still\\nendeavouring to make light of it, “learn that is the lord Marquis's\\nsignature to his order of my dismissal from his service.”\\n\\n“The dog!” ejaculated the school-master.\\n\\n“Sh! let it be. Perhaps braved him overmuch will tell you of it\\nwhen these good folks have gone. Do not let us cast a gloom over their\\nhappiness, old master. And now to embrace this good Charlot.”\\n\\nThough inwardly burning with curiosity and boiling with indignation,\\nDuhamel permitted himself to be guided by La Boulaye, and for the moment\\nallowed the matter to rest. La Boulaye himself laughingly set aside the\\nmany questions with which they pressed him. He drank the health of the\\nbride-elect--who was not yet of the party--and he pledged the happiness\\nof the pair. He embraced Charlot, and even went so far as to urge upon\\nhim, out of his own scanty store, a louis d'or with which to buy Marie a\\ntrinket in memory of him.\\n\\nThen presently came one with the announcement that. le Cure was\\nwaiting, and in answer to that reminder that there was a ceremony to be\\ngone through, Charlot and his friends flung out of the house in joyous\\nconfusion, and went their way with laughter and jest to the little\\nchurch of St. Ildefonse.\\n\\n“We will follow presently--M. la Boulaye and--Charlot,” Duhamel had\\nsaid, as the sturdy bridegroom was departing. “We shall be there to\\nshake Madame by the hand and wish her joy of you.”\\n\\nWhen at last they were alone in the schoolmaster's room, the old man\\nturned to La Boulaye, the very embodiment of a note of interrogation.\\nThe secretary told him all that had passed. He reddened slightly when\\nit came to speaking of his love for Mlle. de Bellecour, but he realised\\nthat if he would have guidance he must withhold nothing from his friend.\\n\\nDuhamel's face grew dark as the young man spoke, and his eyes became sad\\nand very thoughtful.\\n\\n“Alas!” he sighed, when La Boulaye had ended. “What shall say to you,\\nmy friend? The time is not yet for such as we--you and--to speak of\\nlove for a daughter of the Seigneurie. It is coming, I doubt it not. All\\nthings have their climax, and France is tending swiftly to the climax\\nof her serfdom. Very soon we shall have the crisis, this fire that is\\nalready smouldering, will leap into a great blaze, that shall lick the\\nold regime as completely from the face of history as though it had never\\nbeen new condition of things will spring up, of that am convinced.\\nDoes not history afford us many instances? And what is history but the\\nrepetition of events under similar circumstances with different peoples.\\nIt will come in France, and it will come soon, for it is very direly\\nneeded.”\\n\\n“I know, I know, old master,” broke in La Boulaye; “but how shall all\\nthis help me? For all that have the welfare of France at heart, it\\nweighs little with me at the moment by comparison with my own affairs.\\nWhat am to do, Duhamel? How am to take payment for this?” And he\\npressed his finger to his seared cheek.\\n\\n“Wait,” said the old man impressively. “That is the moral you might have\\ndrawn from what have said. Be patient promise you your patience\\nshall not be overtaxed. To-day they say that you presume; that you are\\nnot one of them--although, by my soul, you have as good an air as any\\nnobleman in France.” And he eyed the lean height of the secretary with a\\nglance of such pride as a father might take in a well-grown son.\\n\\nElegant of figure, La Boulaye was no less elegant in dress, for all\\nthat, from head to foot--saving the silver buckles on his shoes and the\\nunpretentious lace at throat and wrists--he was dressed in the black\\nthat his office demanded. His countenance, too, though cast in a mould\\nof thoughtfulness that bordered on the melancholy, bore a lofty stamp\\nthat might have passed for birth and breeding, and this was enhanced by\\nthe careful dressing of his black unpowdered hair, gathered into a club\\nby a broad ribbon of black silk.\\n\\n“But what shall waiting avail me?” cried the young man, with some\\nimpatience. “What am to do in the meantime?”\\n\\n“Go to Amiens,” said the other. “You have learning, you have eloquence,\\nyou have a presence and an excellent address. For success no\\nbetter attributes could be yours.” He approached the secretary, and\\ninstinctively lowered his voice. “We have a little club there--a sort of\\nsuccursal to the Jacobins. We are numerous, but we have no very shining\\nmember yet. Come with me, and will nominate you. Beginning thus,\\nI promise you that you shall presently become a man of prominence\\nin Picardy. Anon we may send you to Paris to represent us in the\\nStates-General. Then, when the change comes, who shall say to what\\nheights it may not be yours to leap?”\\n\\n“I will think of it,” answered La Boulaye cordially, “and not a doubt of\\nit but that will come did not know that you had gone so far--”\\n\\n“Sh! You know now. Let that suffice. It is not good to talk of these\\nthings just yet.”\\n\\n“But in the meantime,” La Boulaye persisted, “what of this?” And again\\nhe pointed to his cheek.\\n\\n“Why, let it heal, boy.”\\n\\n“I promised the Marquis that would demand satisfaction of his son, and am tempted to do so and risk the consequences.”\\n\\n“I am afraid the consequences will be the only satisfaction that you\\nwill get. In fact, they will be anticipations rather than consequences,\\nfor they'll never let you near the boy.”\\n\\n“I know not that,” he answered. “The lad is more generous than his sire,\\nand if were to send him word that have been affronted, he might\\nconsent to meet me. For the rest, I could kill him blindfolded,” he\\nadded, with a shrug.\\n\\n“Bloodthirsty animal!” rejoined Duhamel. “Unnatural tutor! Do you forget\\nthat you were the boy's preceptor?”\\n\\nWith that Duhamel carried the argument into new fields, and showed La\\nBoulaye that to avenge upon the young Vicomte the insults received\\nat the hands of the old Marquis was hardly a worthy method of taking\\nvengeance. At last he won him to his way, and it was settled that on the\\nmorrow La Boulaye should journey with him to Amiens.\\n\\n“But, Caron, we are forgetting our friend Charlot and his bride,” he\\nbroke off suddenly. “Come, boy; the ceremony will be at an end by this.”\\n\\nHe took La Boulaye by the arm, and led him out and down the street to\\nthe open space opposite St. Ildefonse. The wedding-party was streaming\\nout through the door of the little church into the warm sunshine of that\\nApril morning. In the churchyard they formed into a procession of happy\\nbe-ribboned and nosegayed men and women--the young preceding, the old\\nfollowing, the bridal couple. Two by two they came, and the air rang\\nwith their laughter and joyous chatter. Then another sound arose, and if\\nthe secretary and the pedagogue could have guessed of what that beating\\nof hoofs was to be the prelude, they had scarce smiled so easily as they\\nwatched the approaching cortege.\\n\\nFrom a side street there now emerged a gaily apparelled cavalcade. At\\nits head rode the Marquis de Bellecour, the Vicomte, and a half-dozen\\nother gentlemen, followed by, perhaps, a dozen lacqueys. It was a\\nhunting party that was making its way across the village to the open\\ncountry beyond. The bridal procession crossing their path caused them to\\ndraw rein, and to wait until it should have passed--which argued a very\\ncondescending humour, for it would not have been out of keeping with\\ntheir habits to have ridden headlong through it. Their presence cast\\na restraint upon the peasants. The jests were silenced, the laughter\\nhushed, and like a flight of pigeons under the eye of the hawk, they\\nscurried past the Seigneurie, and some of them prayed God that they\\nmight be suffered to pass indeed.\\n\\nBellecour eyed them in cold disdain, until presently Charlot and his\\nbride were abreast of him. Then his eye seemed to take life and his\\nsallow face to kindle into expression. He leant lightly from the saddle.\\n\\n“Stay!” he commanded coldly, and as they came to a halt, daring not to\\ndisobey him--“approach, girl,” he added.\\n\\nCharlot's brows grew black. He looked up at the Marquis, but if his\\nglance was sullen and threatening, it was also not free from fear. Marie\\nobeyed, with eyes downcast and a heightened colour. If she conjectured\\nat all why they had been stopped, it was but to conclude that. le\\nMarquis was about to offer her some mark of appreciation. Uneasiness, in\\nher dear innocence, she knew none.\\n\\n“What is your name, child?” inquired the Marquis more gently.\\n\\n“It was Marie Michelin, Monseigneur,” she made answer timidly. “But it\\nhas just been changed to Marie Tardivet.”\\n\\n“You have just been wed, eh?”\\n\\n“We are on our way from church, Monseigneur.”\\n\\n“C'est ca,” he murmured, as if to himself, and his eyes taking such\\nstock of her as made Charlot burn to tear him from his horse. Then, in a\\nkindly, fatherly voice, he added: “My felicitations, Marie; may you be a\\nhappy wife and a happier mother.”\\n\\n“Merci, Monseigneur,” she murmured, with crimson cheeks, whilst Charlot\\nbreathed once more, and from his heart gave thanks to Heaven, believing\\nthe interview at an end. But he went too fast.\\n\\n“Do you know, Marie, that you are a very comely child?” quoth the\\nMarquis, in tones which made the bridegroom's blood run cold.\\n\\nSome in that noble company nudged one another, and one there was who\\nburst into a loud guffaw.\\n\\n“Charlot has often told me so,” she laughed, all unsuspicious.\\n\\nThe Marquis moved on his horse that he might bend lower. With his\\nforefinger he uptilted her chin, and now, as she met his glance thus at\\nclose quarters, an unaccountable fear took possession of her, and the\\ncolour died out of her plump cheeks.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Bellecour, with a smile, “this Tardivet has good taste. My\\ncongratulations, to him. We must find you a wedding gift, little woman,”\\n he continued more briskly. “It is an ancient and honoured custom that is\\nfalling somewhat into neglect. Go up to the Chateau with Blaise and Jean\\nthere. This good Tardivet must curb his impatience until to-morrow.”\\n\\nHe turned in his saddle, and beckoning the two servants he had named, he\\nbade Marie to mount behind Blaise.\\n\\nShe drew back now, her cheeks white as those of the dead. With a wild\\nterror in her eyes she turned to Charlot, who stood the very picture of\\nanguish and impotent rage. In the cortege, where but a few moments ago\\nall had been laughter, a sob or two sounded now from some of the women.\\n\\n“By my faith,” laughed Bellecour contemptuously eyeing their dejection,\\n“you have more the air of a burial than a bridal party.”\\n\\n“Mercy my lord!” cried the agonised voice of Charlot, as, distraught\\nwith grief, he flung himself before the Marquis.\\n\\n“Who seeks to harm you, fool?” was Bellecour's half-derisive rejoinder.\\n\\n“Do not take her from me, my lord,” the young man pleaded piteously.\\n\\n“She shall return to-morrow, booby,” answered the noble. “Out of the\\nway!”\\n\\nBut Charlot was obstinate. The Marquis might be claiming no more than\\nby ancient law was the due of the Seigneur, but Charlot was by no means\\nminded to submit in craven acquiescence to that brutal, barbarous law.\\n\\n“My lord,” he cried, “you shall not take her. She is my wife. She\\nbelongs to me. You shall not take her!”\\n\\nHe caught hold of the Marquis's bridle with such a strength and angry\\nwill that the horse was forced to back before him.\\n\\n“Insolent clod!” exclaimed Bellecour, with an angry laugh and a sharp,\\ndownward blow of the butt of his whip upon the peasant's head. Charlot's\\nhand grew nerveless and released the bridle as he sank stunned to the\\nground. Bellecour touched his horse with the spur and rode over the\\nprostrate fellow with no more concern than had he been a dog's carcase.\\n“Blaise, see to the girl,” he called over his shoulder, adding to his\\ncompany: “Come, messieurs, we have wasted time enough.”\\n\\nNot a hand was raised to stay him, not a word of protest uttered, as the\\nnobles rode by, laughing, and chatting among themselves, with the utmost\\nunconcern of the tragedy that was being enacted.\\n\\nLike a flock of frightened sheep the peasants stood huddled together and\\nwatched them go. In the same inaction--for all that not a little grief\\nwas blent with the terror on their countenances--they stood by and\\nallowed Blaise to lift the half-swooning girl to the withers of his\\nhorse. No reply had they to the coarse jest with which he and his\\nfellow-servant rode off. But La Boulaye, who, from the point where he\\nand Duhamel had halted, had observed the whole scene from its inception,\\nturned now a livid face upon his companion.\\n\\n“Shall such things be?” he cried passionately. “Merciful God! Are we\\nmen, Duhamel, and do we permit such things to take place?”\\n\\nThe old pedagogue shrugged his shoulders in despair. His face was\\nheavily scored by sorrow.\\n\\n“Helas!” he sighed. “Are they not masters of all that they may take? The\\nMarquis goes no further than is by ancient law allowed his class. It\\nis the law needs altering, my friend, and then the men will alter.\\nMeanwhile, behold them--lords of life and death.”\\n\\n“Lords of hell are they!” blazed the young revolutionist. “That is\\nwhere they belong, whence they are come, and whither they shall return.\\nPoltroons!” he cried, shaking his fist at the group of cowed peasants\\nthat surrounded the prostrate Charlot “Sheep! Worthless clods! The\\nnobles do well to despise you, for, by my faith, you invite nothing but\\ncontempt, you that will suffer rape and murder to be done under your\\neyes, and never do more than look scared encouragement upon your\\nravishers!”\\n\\n“Blame not these poor wretches, Caron,” sighed the old man. “They dare\\nnot raise a hand.”\\n\\n“Then, pardieu! here, at least, is one who does dare,” he cried\\nfuriously, as from the breast pocket of his coat he drew a pistol.\\n\\nBlaise, with the girl across the withers of his horse, was approaching\\nthem, followed by Jean.\\n\\n“What would you do?” cried the old man fearfully, setting a restraining\\nhand upon La Boulaye's sleeve. But Caron shook himself free.\\n\\n“This,” was all he answered, and simultaneously, he levelled his pistol\\nand fired at Blaise.\\n\\nShot through the head, the servant collapsed forward; then, as the horse\\nreared and started off at a gallop, he toppled sideways and fell. The\\ngirl went down with him and lay in the road whilst he was dragged along,\\nhis head bumping horribly on the stones as faster and faster went the\\nfrightened horse.\\n\\nWith a shout that may have been either anger or dismay Jean reined\\nin his horse, and sat for a second hesitating whether to begin by\\nrecovering the girl, or avenging his comrade. But his doubts were solved\\nfor him by La Boulaye, who took a deliberate aim at him.\\n\\n“Begone!” cried the secretary, “unless you prefer to go by the road've\\nsent your fellow.” And being a discreet youth, Jean made off in silence\\nby the street down which poor Blaise had been dragged.\\n\\n“Carom” cried Duhamel, in a frenzy of apprehension. “I tremble for you,\\nmy son. Fly from Bellecour at once--now, this very instant. Go to my\\nfriends at Amiens; they will--”\\n\\nBut Caron had already left his side to repair to the spot where Marie\\nwas lying. The peasantry followed him, though leisurely, in their timid\\nhesitation. They were asking themselves whether, even so remotely as by\\ntending the girl, they dared participate in the violence La Boulaye had\\ncommitted. That a swift vengeance would be the Seigneur's answer\\nthey were well assured, and a great fear possessed them that in that\\nvengeance those of the Chateau might lack discrimination. Charlot was\\namongst them, and on his feet, but still too dazed to have a clear\\nknowledge of the circumstances. Presently, however, his faculties\\nawakening and taking in the situation, he staggered forward, and came\\nlurching towards La Boulaye, who was assisting the frightened Marie to\\nrise. With a great sob the girl flung herself into her husband's arms.\\n\\n“Charlot, mon Charlot!” she cried, and added a moment later: “It was\\nhe--this brave gentleman--who rescued me.”\\n\\n“Monsieur,” said Charlot, “I shall remember it to my dying day.”\\n\\nHe would have said more, but the peasants, stirred by fear, now roused\\nthemselves and plucked at his coat.\\n\\n“Get you gone, Charlot, Get you gone quickly,” they advised him. “And if\\nyou are wise you will leave Bellecour without delay. It is not safe for\\nyou here.”\\n\\n“It is not safe for any of us,” exclaimed one. “I have no mind to be\\ncaught when the Seigneur returns. There will be a vengeance. Ah Dieu!\\nwhat a vengeance!”\\n\\nThe warning acted magically. There were hurried leave-takings, and then,\\nlike a parcel of scuttling rabbits, they made for their burrows to hide\\nfrom the huntsman that would not be long in coming. And ere the last of\\nthem was out of sight there arose a stamping of hoofs and a chorus\\nof angry voices. Down tine street thundered the Marquis's cavalcade,\\nbrought back by the servant who had escaped and who had ridden after\\nthem. Some anger there was--particularly in the heart of the Lord of\\nBellecour--but greater than their anger was their excitement at the\\nprospect of a man-hunt, with which the chase on which they had been\\noriginally bent made but a poor comparison.\\n\\n“There he is, Monseigneur” cried Jean, as he pointed to La Boulaye. “And\\nyonder are the girl and her husband.”\\n\\n“Ah! The secretary again, eh?” laughed the nobleman, grimly, as he\\ncame nearer. “Ma foi, life must have grown wearisome to him. Secure the\\nwoman, Jean.”\\n\\nCaron stood before him, pale in his impotent rage, which was directed\\nas much against the peasants who had fled as against the nobles who\\napproached. Had these clods but stood there, and defended themselves and\\ntheir manhood with sticks and stones and such weapons as came to their\\nhands, they might have taken pride in being trampled beneath the hoofs\\nof the Seigneurie. Thus, at least, might they have proved themselves\\nmen. But to fly thus--some fifty of them from the approach of less than\\na score--was to confess unworthiness of a better fate than that of which\\ntheir seigneurs rendered themselves the instruments.\\n\\nHimself he could do no more than the single shot in his pistol would\\nallow. That much, however, he would do, and like him whose resources\\nare reduced, and yet who desires to spend the little that he has to best\\nadvantage, he levelled the weapon boldly at the advancing Marquis, and\\npulled the trigger. But Bellecour was an old campaigner, and by an old\\ncampaigner's trick he saved himself at the last moment. At sight of that\\nlevelled barrel he pulled his horse suddenly on to its haunches, and\\nreceived the charge in the animal's belly. With a shriek of pain the\\nhorse sought to recover its feet, then tumbled forward hurling the\\nMarquis from the saddle. La Boulaye had an inspiration to fling himself\\nupon the old roue and seek with his hands to kill him before they\\nmade an end of himself. But ere he could move to execute his design a\\nhorseman was almost on top of him. He received a stunning blow on the\\nhead. The daylight faded in his eyes, he felt a sensation of sinking,\\nand a reverberating darkness engulfed him\\n\\n\\nWhen La Boulaye recovered consciousness he was lying on his back in the\\nmiddle of the courtyard of the Chateau de Bellecour. From a great stone\\nbalcony above, a little group, of which Mademoiselle de Bellecour\\nwas the centre, observed the scene about the captive, who was being\\nresuscitated that he might fittingly experience the Seigneur's\\nvengeance.\\n\\nShe had returned from the morning's affair in the park with a conscience\\nnot altogether easy. To have stood by whilst her father had struck\\nCaron, and moreover, to have done so without any sense of horror, or\\neven of regret, was a matter in which she asked herself whether she had\\ndone well. Certainly La Boulaye had presumed unpardonably in speaking\\nto her as he had spoken, and for his presumption it was fitting that\\nhe should be punished. Had she interfered she must have seemed to\\nsympathise, and thus the lesson might have suffered in salutariness.\\nAnd yet Caron La Boulaye was a man of most excellent exterior, and, when\\npassion had roused him out of his restraint and awkwardness, of most\\nardent and eloquent address. The very sombreness that--be it from his\\nmournful garments or from a mind of thoughtful habit--seemed to envelop\\nhim was but an additional note of poetry in a personality which struck\\nher now as eminently poetical. In the seclusion of her own chamber, as\\nshe recalled the burning words and the fall of her father's whip upon\\nthe young man's pale face, she even permitted herself to sigh. Had he\\nbut been of her own station, he had been such a man as she would have\\ntaken pride in being wooed by. As it was--she halted there and laughed\\ndisdainfully, yet with never so faint a note of regret. It was absurd!\\nShe was Mademoiselle de Bellecour, and he her father's secretary;\\neducated, if you will--aye, and beyond his station--but a vassal withal,\\nand very humbly born. Yes, it was absurd, she told herself again: the\\neagle may not mate with the sparrow.\\n\\nAnd when presently she had come from her chamber, she had been\\ngreeted with the story of a rebellion in the village, and an attempted\\nassassination of her father. The ringleader, she was told, had been\\nbrought to the Chateau, and he was even then in the courtyard and about\\nto be hanged by the Marquis. Curious to behold this unfortunate, she had\\nstepped out on to the balcony where already an idle group had formed.\\nInexpressible had been her shock upon seeing him that lay below, his\\nwhite face upturned to the heavens, his eyes closed.\\n\\n“Is he dead?” she asked, when presently she had overcome her feelings.\\n\\n“Not yet Mademoiselle,” answered the graceful Chevalier de Jacquelin,\\ntoying with his solitaire. “Your father is bringing him to life that he\\nmay send him back to death.”\\n\\nAnd then she heard her father's voice behind her. The Marquis had\\nstepped out on to the balcony to ascertain whether La Boulaye had yet\\nregained consciousness.\\n\\n“He seems to be even now recovering,” said someone.\\n\\n“Ah, you are there, Suzanne,” cried Bellecour. “You see your friend the\\nsecretary there. He has chosen to present himself in a new role to-day.\\nFrom being my servant, it seems that he would constitute himself my\\nmurderer.”\\n\\nHowever unfilial it might be, she could not stifle a certain sympathy\\nfor this young man. She imagined that his rebellion, whatever shape it\\nhad assumed, had been provoked by that weal upon his face; and it seemed\\nto her then that he had been less than a man had he not attempted to\\nexact some reparation for the hurt the whip had inflicted at once upon\\nhis body and his soul.\\n\\n“But what is it that he has done, Monsieur?” she asked, seeking more\\nthan the scant information which so far she had received.\\n\\n“Enough, at least, to justify my hanging him,” answered Bellecour\\ngrimly. “He sought to withstand my authority; he incited the peasants\\nof Bellecour to withstand it; he has killed Blaise, and he would have\\nkilled me but that preferred to let him kill my horse.”\\n\\n“In what way did he seek to withstand your authority!” she persisted.\\n\\nHe stared at her, half surprised, half angry.\\n\\n“What doers the manner of it signify?” he asked impatiently. “Is not the\\nfact enough? Is it not enough that Blaise is dead, and that have had a\\nnarrow escape, at his hands?”\\n\\n“Insolent hound that he is!” put in Madame la Marquise--a fleshly lady\\nmonstrously coiffed. “If we allow such men as thus to live in France our\\ndays are numbered.”\\n\\n“They say that you are going to hang him,” said Suzanne, heedless of her\\nmother's words, and there was the faintest note of horror in her voice.\\n\\n“They are mistaken am not.”\\n\\n“You are not?” cried the Marquise. “But what, then, do you intend to\\ndo?”\\n\\n“To keep my word, madame,” he answered her. “I promised that canaille\\nthat if he ever came within the grounds of Bellecour would have him\\nflogged to death. That is what propose.”\\n\\n“Father,” gasped Suzanne, in horror, a horror that was echoed by the\\nother three or four ladies present. But the Marquise only laughed.\\n\\n“He will be; richly served,” she approved, with a sage nod of her\\npumpkin-like head-dress--“most richly served.”\\n\\nA great pity arose now in the heart of Mademoiselle, as her father went\\nbelow that he might carry out his barbarous design. She was deaf to\\nthe dainty trifles which the most elegant Chevalier de Jacquelin was\\nmurmuring into her ear. She stood, a tall, queenly figure, at the\\nbalcony's parapet and watched the preparations that were being made.\\n\\nShe heard her father's harshly-voiced commands. She saw them literally\\ntear the clothes from the unfortunate secretary's back, and lash\\nhim--naked to the waist--to the pump that stood by the horse-trough at\\nthe far end of the yard. His body was now hidden from her sight, but his\\nhead appeared surmounting the pillar of the pump, his chin seeming to\\nrest upon its summit, and his face was towards her. At his side stood a\\npowerful knave armed with a stout, leather-thonged whip.\\n\\n“How many strokes, Monseigneur?” she heard the man inquire.\\n\\n“How many?” echoed the Marquise. “Do know how many it will take to\\nmake an end of him? Beat him to death, man. Allons! Set about it.”\\n\\nShe saw the man uncoil his lash and step forward. In that instant\\nCaron's eyes were raised, and they met hers across the intervening\\nspace. He smiled a valedictory smile that seemed to make her heart stand\\nstill. She and her mother were now the only women on the balcony.\\nThe others had made haste to withdraw as soon as La Boulaye had\\nbeen pilloried. The Marquise remained because she seemed to find\\nentertainment in the spectacle. Suzanne remained because horror rooted\\nher to the spot--horror and a great pity for this unfortunate who had\\nlooked so strong and brave that morning, when he had had the audacity to\\ntell her that he loved her.\\n\\nThe lash sang through the air, quivered, hummed, and cut with a\\nsickening crackle into the young man's flesh.\\n\\nThe hideous sound roused her. She shuddered from head to foot, and\\nturning she put her hands to her face and rushed within, followed by the\\nMarquise's derisive laughter.\\n\\n“Mon Dieu! It is horrible! Horrible!” she cried as she sank into the\\nnearest chair, and clapped her hands to her ears. But she could not shut\\nit out. Still she heard the humming of the whip and the cruel sound of\\nthe falling blows. Mechanically she counted them, unconsciously almost,\\nand at twenty she heard them cease. Was it over? Was he dead, this poor\\nunfortunate? Moved by a curiosity that was greater than her loathing,\\nshe rose and went to the threshold of the balcony.\\n\\n“Is it ended?” she asked.\\n\\n“Ended?” echoed Monsieur de Jacquelin, with a shrug. “It is scarce\\nbegun, it seems. The executioner is pausing for breath, that is all. The\\nfellow has not uttered a sound. He is as obstinate as a mule.”\\n\\n“As enduring as a Spartan,” more generously put in the Vicomte, her\\nbrother. “Look at him, Suzanne.”\\n\\nAlmost involuntarily she obeyed, and moved forward a step that she\\nmight behold him face, deathly pale, she saw, which in the sunshine\\nglistened with the sweat of agony that bedewed it; but the lips were\\ntightly closed and the countenance grimly expressionless. Even as she\\nlooked she heard her father command the man to lay on anew. Then, as\\nbefore, his eyes met hers; but this time no smile did she see investing\\nthem.\\n\\nAgain the whip cracked and fell. She drew back, but his glance seemed\\nto haunt her even when she no longer saw his face sudden resolution\\nmoved her, and in a frenzy of anger and compassion she flung out of\\nthe room moment later she burst like a beautiful virago into the\\ncourtyard.\\n\\n“Stop!” she commanded shrilly, causing both her father and the\\nexecutioner to turn, and the latter pausing in his hideous work. But a\\nglance from the Marquis bade him resume, and resume he did, as though\\nthere had been no interruption.\\n\\n“What is this?” demanded Bellecour, half amused, half vexed, whilst a\\nsudden new light leapt to the eyes of La Boulaye, which but a moment\\nback had been so full of agony.\\n\\nBut Mademoiselle never paused to answer her father. Seeing the\\nexecutioner proceeding, despite her call to cease, she sprang upon him,\\ncaught him by the arms and wrested the whip from hands that dared not\\nresist her.\\n\\n“Did not bid you stop?” she blazed, her face white, her eyes on fire;\\nand raising the whip she brought it down upon his head and shoulders,\\nnot once but half-a-dozen times in quick succession, until he fled,\\nhowling, to the other side of the horse trough for shelter. “It stings\\nyou, does it” she cried, whilst the Marquis, from angered that at first\\nhe had been, now burst into a laugh at her fury and at this turning of\\ntables upon the executioner. She made shift to pursue the fellow to his\\nplace of refuge, but coming of a sudden upon the ghastly sight presented\\nby La Boulaye's lacerated back, she drew back in horror. Then, mastering\\nherself--for girl though she was, her courage was of a high order--she\\nturned to her father.\\n\\n“Give this man to me, Monsieur,” she begged.\\n\\n“To you!” he exclaimed. “What will you do with him?”\\n\\n“I will see that you are rid of him,” she promised. “What more can you\\ndesire? You have tortured him enough.”\\n\\n“Maybe. But am to blame that he dies so hard?”\\n\\nShe answered him with renewed insistence, and unexpectedly she received\\nan ally in. des Cadoux--an elderly gentleman who had been observing\\nthe flogging with disapproval, and who had followed her into the\\ncourtyard.\\n\\n“He is too brave a man to die like this, Bellecour,” put in the\\nnewcomer. “I doubt if he can survive the punishment he has already\\nreceived. Yet would ask you, in the name of courage, to give him the\\nslender chance he may have.”\\n\\n“I promised him he should be flogged to death--” began the Marquis,\\nwhen Des Cadoux and Mademoiselle jointly interrupted him to renew their\\nintercessions.\\n\\n“But, sangdieu,” the Marquis protested “you seem to forget that he has\\nkilled one of my servants.”\\n\\n“Why, then, you should have hanged him out of hand, not tortured him\\nthus,” answered Des Cadoux shortly.\\n\\nFor a moment it almost seemed as if the pair of them would have fallen\\na-quarrelling. Their words grew more heated, and then, while they were\\nstill wrangling, the executioner came forward to solve matters with the\\nnews that the secretary had expired. To Bellecour this proved a very\\nwelcome conclusion.\\n\\n“Most opportunely!” he laughed “Had the rascal lived another minute\\nthink we had quarrelled, Cadoux.” He turned to the servant, “You are\\ncertain that it is so?” he asked.\\n\\n“Look, Monsieur,” said the fellow, as he pointed with his whip to the\\npilloried figure of La Boulaye. The Marquis looked, and saw that the\\nsecretary had collapsed, and hung limp in his bonds, his head fallen\\nback upon his shoulders and his eyes closed.\\n\\nWith a shrug and a short laugh Bellecour turned to his daughter.\\n\\n“You may take the carrion, if you want to. But think you can do no\\nmore than order it to be flung into a ditch and buried there.”\\n\\nBut she had no mind to be advised by him. She had the young man's body\\ncut down from the pump, and she bade a couple of servants convey it to\\nthe house of Master Duhamel, she for remembered that La Boulaye and the\\nold pedagogue were friends.\\n\\n“An odd thing is a woman's heart,” grumbled the Marquis, who begrudged\\nLa Boulaye even his last act of mercy. “She may care never a fig for a\\nman, and yet, if he has but told her that he loves her, be he never\\nso mean and she never so exalted, he seems thereby to establish some\\nmeasure of claim to her.”\""
